## Challenges
- I made the decision to hand roll my own API. Having never used Express before, this proved to be time consuming and research dense.
- Route and Link did not work as intended. This required an intense period of research which took away from being able to add a horoscope.

## Wins
- Learning Express in 5 days and creating my own API.
- Although the design of this project needs some refining, I had a blast making it and learned some really interesting design techniques.
